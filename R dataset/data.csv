"Jim Harbaugh";"Liberec, Czech Republic - Alhambra was great - BUT FOR THE ONLINE TICKETS PURCHASE - 5";2012-05-23;"We absolutely agree with everyone praising Alhambra here. It really was breathtaking.BUT-HERE WE WANT TO WARN EVERYBODY against purchasing tickets in advance via web portals such as secure.bookyourtour.info OR www.ticketmonument.com. Apparently different companies, but your money will end up at the same bank account. We were very disappointed by the TicketMonument's approach in particular.INFORMATION THEY GAVE US WERE FALSE AND THE CHARGED US FOR TICKETS WE HADN'T WANTED!We made our booking in advance to make sure we'll be able to get there. Firstly, our booking was cancelled because while travelling we couldn't view one of their confirmation e-mails in html and click on a certain link consequently. Then we made enquires about a different date (not a very convenient one this time) and finally we needed to book a guided tour for they informed us there are no non-guided visit tickets for our entire stay in Granada left.WHEN WE ACTUALLY GOT IN THE PLACE (it was in May 2012) WE SAW HOW EASY IT WAS TO BUY THE TICKETS DIRECTLY IN ALHABRA OR IN NEARLY ANY OTHER PLACE IN GRANADA, our hotel included. AND FOR FAR LESS MONEY!! THE INFORMATION GIVEN US BY THE TICKETMONUMENT WERE FALSE - THERE WERE PLENTY OF TICKETS AVAILABLE.And we also realised THE HAD CHARGED US EVEN FOR TICKETS WE HAD NOT CONFIRMED apart from the actual incredibly expensive guided-tour tickets we had bought believing there was no other way to get in the Alhambra. NO CANCELLATION OF THE UNWANTED TICKETS WERE MADE POSSIBLE. Even though local people and tourist offices tried hard to solve our problem.We recommend buying the tickets at the spot, or at least in not a very busy season.A married couple from Europe"
"Joe Flacco";"Bedford, England - Amazing and stunning - not to be missed - 5";2013-08-25;"The Alhambra is justifiably the no.1 attraction in Granada and is a definite 'must see'. As stated in other reviews, pre-booking online is highly advised. We popped into the Alhambra shop in Granada the day before our visit and printed the tickets at their ServiCaixa ATM. The lady at the desk was very helpful and supplied with an Alhambra map as well. Having tickets enabled us to enter at the Justice Gate (not crowded) and go straight to our time allocated slot at the Nasrid Palaces. Purchased 2 audio guides (6 euros each) - ok for adults but not for children as commentary is somewhat 'poetic'. Queued for half an hour before entering the Palace complex. As there is a limit to entry numbers, the crowds were nowhere near as bad as I thought they would be. The Palaces are amazing to see - a photographers paradise. But put the camera down for a while and just take in the stunning architecture, study the intricate detail of the designs - it's truly inspiring. It takes at least an hour to see this area properly (we took over 90 mins) - kids will be bored by then! The Partal area is next (includes the gardens) and is a welcome change from the Palaces - not many people and a good place to chill, drink some water and enjoy the views. Walk up to the Generalife and wander through the lovely water gardens. There were less people here and it was much more relaxed. Use the tourist map provided to make sure you see all the best sights. The whole visit took us 6 hours (including lunch) but you could do it in 3 to 4 hours. Toilets and limited vending machines available.Highly recommended for adults - less interesting for children.TIP - Stop off at the Parador in the middle of the Alhambra for a drink or a meal. The prices are reasonable and its a quiet and shady rest from the heat."
"Tom Brady";"South Wales - A Moorish Dream - 5";2012-10-16;"The Alhambra Palace complements my previous visits to Cordoba and Seville. The Alhambra is a huge combination of fortress and palace and you can easily spend half a day there. The architecture of the palaces does not fail to astound. On a practical note, I was able to book tickets in advance over the internet via the Alhambra website. We just bought the normal tickets which were then printed out at a designated cash point machine in Granada the day before the visit. We easily caught a bus up to the Alhambra from Granada town and it was a bonus having the tickets in advance because we could just walk in without queuing. You can wander around the Generalife gardens as you like and visit the fortress/Alcazaba in your own time. The only queue was for the palaces, once you are there. You have to opt for a time to visit the Nasrid palaces - even so, I waited 45 minutes in advance of my timeslot to secure my place! There are limited refreshment facilities/toilets on the site (no sit-down cafe) and you can't eat your own sandwiches as you wander around either, so you have to plan this aspect carefully! It is a beautiful place to visit and if you are well prepared by taking water and wearing comfortable shoes, you will have a memorable time!"
"Al Davis";"Surrey England - Wonderful history and has to be seen - 4";2016-03-04;"If you are in Granada you have to visit The Alhambra. There is a daily limit on the number of visitors so you should book in advance. In the summer and holidays you need to book well in advance. You can book online. You either book a morning or afternoon visit. When you book your tickets you have to book a fixed time to enter the Nasrid Palace.To collect your tickets you must take with you the credit card that you booked with.You can collect your tickets in advance from the Alhambra shop which is situated on Calle Rayes near the main square. If you collect your tickets in advance you can enter the Alhambra at the nearer Gate of Justice. If you don't have your tickets you have to collect them from the main entrance which is at the top near the car parks. If you are reasonably fit you can easily walk to The Alhambra from the city centre in 20 minutes. It is mainly uphill. There are loads of shuttle buses running from the city up to The Alhambra if you cannot walk. For most visitors I would suggest two and a half hours to visit. We started at the Generalife and then went into The Alhambra and finished with the Nasrid Palace. This worked very well and we ended on the high of the Nasrid Palace. You have to queue up for your time slot for the Nasrid Palace and they let your group in at the exact time on your ticket. There are 300 let in each 30 minutes so it is very busy. Don't queue up and try and get in if it is not your time on the ticket. They will send you away.There are lots of drinking fountains. There is a reasonably priced kiosk selling coffee and rolls.In the summer take a hat and plenty of sun cream.Enjoy wandering the grounds, buildings and palaces. It was great."
"Bill O'Brien";"Vienna, Austria - A must-see, but be aware of entry times confusion! - 5";2013-04-07;"The Alahambra was amazing and my entire family enjoyed the experience. The palace itself is stunning and the views are beautiful, its a must see in Spain. We had been warned about entry times selling out, so we thought we would avoid the problem and just book tickets with Ticketmaster in advance. The confusing piece (which was not clearly explained anywhere that I was able to understand, and I speak fluent Spanish) is that the entry time on your ticket is your entry time into the the Palace itself, not the entire Alahambra compound. And it takes a good 15 minutes of walking to get from where you pick up your tickets and where you enter the Palace (after waiting in line again). And there are many, many things to see on the walk to the line to get into the palace. So, our entry ticket said 1400, and we went through the main entry gate at 1400, but we did not get into line to enter the palace until closer to 1500, and after waiting in line for about 5 minutes, a guide came and looked at our tickets and turned us away to go to customer service and get a new entry time since we had missed ours. Once we got our new entry time (which did only take about 10 extra minutes), we went back to enter the palace and watched the same guide turn away about half of the people in line who had the exact same problem we did. The whole entry time issue was not clearly explained and was obviously misunderstood by many, many visitors. The palace was well worth the inconvenience, but be aware and avoid the confusion we had! :)"
"Joe Flacco";"London, United Kingdom - Jobsworth woman made my son cry and ruined our day - 1";2016-05-04;"Firstly this is an amazing place to visit, but make sure you book tickets well in advance, we didn't and had to do a night time guided tour which was still great. As part of the package we were told that our tickets allowed us to visit the rest of the site until 2pm the next day. Despite being allowed into the Alcazaba fortress and Palace of Carlos V by the people checking our tickets, and again at the entrance to the gardens, when we got up to the General Life area my 2 year old son was denied access to the Patio de la Acequia as his ticket was apparently not valid for some reason, although mine and my wife's that we bought at the same time were (and kids also go free). I'd also carried him for 25 mins on my shoulders to get up there. I tried pleading but still got nowhere, my son even tried to give the female ticket inspector his ticket, and then started to cry when she wouldn't take it. I know rules are rules but this was totally ridiculous, he's two, (and kids go free), nobody else that day had a problem with our tickets. I really feel that this woman deliberately went out of her way to be as difficult and horrible as possible, maybe she doesn't have kids? or delights in making them cry. It really spoiled what should have been a great day out. It was especially sad as I know my son would have loved looking the water features there. We tried to make a complaint on the day, but again got nowhere, I'm very disappointed by the lack of empathy by the staff. On my sons figures of evil she's on a par with Jafar in Aladdin, he hasn't seen Chitty Chitty Bang Bang yet."
"Bill O'Brien";"Concord, California - Alternative place to purchase tix for last minute people... - 4";2012-06-07;"So I didn't realize you had to buy your tickets in advance and wasn't actually made aware of this until my friend mentioned it to me two days before I was planning to go. Needless to say, I rushed to the official website and found, to my dismay, tickets were sold out the day I wanted to go and a few days after... But I persevered and found you can buy the Bono Turistico or Granada Tourist Voucher, which lets you visit La Alhambra and several other places over a 3 (or 5) day time period. Also, they include a 5 trip city bus ticket that you can use getting from one location to the next. If you buy the 5 day, you get 9 trips on the city bus, I believe. Since I only went to La Alhambra and the Science museum, I didn't ask if the 5 trips are one ways or round trips. But even if you had to pay for the additionaly trips, it still seems like a deal with all the free entries into some of the other attractions. The best thing was they had a lot more time slots open for La Alhambra and I got the exact time I wanted. Here's the website...http://bonoturistico.caja-granada.es. The website is also in English. Tickets can't be printed, but can be picked up at a few different locations. I picked mine up at City Hall, which was on the way to La Alhambra anyway."
"Adam Schaefter";"Melbourne, Australia - Experience ruined by maintenance work.............. - 3";2016-08-22;"We visited this place with a group tour back in July when the weather was very hot. Ticket and queuing were taken care of! Again, joining the tour group means ""jumping"" the queue virtually all the time (saving time and not having to wait under the hot sun). Based on our research, we thought we would be happy with our choice of this place. Unfortunately, it wasn't to be as the central piece of this place was under full scale maintenance-the garden with the rectangular pond had most of its water plants taken out. It appeared they were ""cleaning or clearing"" the pond, not sure if the pump system was the problem. Therefore you could imagine under the hot sun, the smell of the silt and/or mud was very ""challenging""! Due to two or three other section of the palace were also having some sort of maintenance done, it impacted on the number of visitors allowed in. Still it was very crowded. IF ONLY they could pre-warn/alert visitors earlier??I am reviewing this place after I had visited the Real Alcazar in Seville two days later, simply because for those who are touring Spain as a whole and taking in Granada and Seville, Real Alcazar is a better place to visit. Most of Alhambra rooms and building are a ""grade"" below the finesse and details of Alcazar. But if you are only visiting Granada (and not Seville), then this place is for you. You may consider visiting the place without the tickets of going inside to see some of the rooms. If you are not joining an organised tour (i.e. tour guide), try to equip your self with a map of Alhambra, otherwise you would definitely end up spending more time than you plan to. Try to allow three hours if it is ""peak"" season. You will spend a lot of time waiting for everything."
"Adam Schaefter";"Calgary - Don't feed the cats! - 5";2016-03-28;"Okay, the cats are there, not really a feature, just don't feed them! Our visit to Granada was mainly to see the Alhambra, time well spent! It is recommended that you book your entrance ticket beforehand as there is a limit of 6600 visitors per day. This can seem like a large number, but remember, Alhambra is Spain's most visited tourist site, so book early. This a large complex, so allow plenty of time to see it. We were able to move through it quite easily as our group of four had our personal guide. But it is well organized so as to allow people moving through quite smoothly. It is a very interesting place historically, and visually. Even though we were there in mid-February, the grounds were still very pretty. The architecture stunning, the mathematical abilities and engineering ingenuity very impressive. Be sure that if you aren't taking a guided tour that you study up on Alhambra before you go!The whole tour also takes in Generalife, which was the Sultan's summer palace. Impressive are the fountains, all gravity fed. Water plays a big part of the design here. Take delight in the intricate, fancy designs of the walkways. When you are done, you will appreciate why this a must see when visiting Andalucia."
"Bill O'Brien";"Sweden - Worth a visit - 5";2015-04-21;"Alhambra was just amazing. There are busses going to the top, but we actually walked all the way, which I preferred. It is quite important to book the tickets in advance because they can be hard to get otherwise. 1/3 of the tickets are released well in advance, 1/3 a few days before and the rest is basically for the same day so the ticket system is a bit difficult. There are also different types of tickets, but we chose the one which included everything which was about 16 euros if I remember correctly. Only a limited amount of people can be at there at the same time so you actually get an hour for when you can visit the Alhambra. We for example were allowed to enter from 14 until 20. The area is quite big so you should plan a bit how to visit it. If you have the tickets for the Palacio Nazaries, you actually have to be there at a certain hour and if you miss your slot, you can’t enter, so you should plan your visit according to that.We started by visiting the Generalife, which was the summer house of the residents of the Alcazaba. It is a really pretty palace with amazing views over Sacromonte and Albayzín. After that we went to the Alcazaba which is the fort of Alhambra. The view up there were even more amazing and you could see the whole of Granada. Last we visited the Palacio Nazaries which was the usual residence of the Alcazaba. There you can find the famous lion fountain. As I said earlier, to this place you have to enter at the time given or otherwise you miss your slot.We actually ended up skipping the museum which was inside. In total, we spent about 5,5 hours in Alhambra. It is definitely worth a visit and you should remember that it includes a lot of walking and climbing."
"Jim Harbaugh";"Brighouse, United Kingdom - Unmissable - 5";2015-12-09;"The Alhambra is, undoubtedly an unmissable attraction if you're in southern Spain but it is something you need to plan for and can be rather confusing if you do it independently.If, like us, you are staying on the coast and have a car, it's a 90 minute spectacular drive from Malaga. If you're visiting in winter remember it may well be much colder there. When we set off it was 22 degrees when we got to Granada it was 7, so remember to take some warm clothing.It is easy to find from the motorway and is well signed.You need to book tickets in advance (2 - 3 weeks) from ticketmaster.es which you collect from the ticket office next to the car park. If you book a 2pm visit to the palaces, you are not even permitted to enter the grounds until then. However you can visit the museum, the Santa Maria church and the baths. It's a good idea to visit the museum first as they have English speaking volunteers who will show you round for free and you get a good introduction to the place. You can also visit the Convent of San Francisco which is now a hotel and is a nice place for a drink or some lunch. To enter the palaces you need to go to the gardens on the western side of the museum. Once you've visited the palaces you are free to see the rest of the site and stay as long as you like. We arrived at 11 and had to leave at 5 but still did not get to see everything."
"Tom Brady";"Washington DC, District of Columbia - Absolutely Stunning!! Twenty Year dream come true!! - 5";2015-08-08;"Before I even start...BOOK YOUR TICKET AHEAD!!! This place is often sold out for days and you can easily find yourself unable to find a ticket even if you're in town for two weeks. I booked 3 months ahead on ticket master so I didn't have to wait in the HUGE lines that are there all day long. Upon arriving in Granada...I could see this huge palace fortress complex standing on the mountain above the city it once ruled over!!! Very moving to say the least OMG! I'm a historian and I'd waited 20 years for this. I was not disappointed by any hair. This experience exceeded my expectations further than any experience I think I've had as a traveler of the world. There are several palaces within the huge fortress walls on the side of this mountain. I was awestruck just entering the massive gates...I climbed the mountain to reach the main entrance and was drenched. Take a cab or catch the shuttle from the city center for $1. They give you a map and you can rent a audio guide...do it if you're not doing a private tour. Geez...no way to explain it...the engineering, the medina, the general life quarters, they had a steam room and hot/cold running water 1,000 years ago wth!!! By far the most complex intricate architecture in Europe...give yourself several hours to do yourself justice here...A MUST SEE!"
"Jim Harbaugh";"Leicester, United Kingdom - Worth a trip of a thousand miles! - 5";2016-02-17;"Beautiful, magnificent, intriguing, interesting, a balm to the spirit and a stimulation to the mind - the Alhambra is a unique and wonderful place. The cool courtyards and Generalife gardens are so well designed for the hot summer of Granada. The decoration is a delight and a wonder - the amazing tessellations give a sense of the infinite and are reputed to include examples of all 17 plane symmetry groups (look it up before you go!)How many times have I visited? I've lost count, and I still see new things every time I go, and I'm still thrilled every time.Tip1:The web site is not good, but you can buy tickets on the day if you don't mind a bit of a queue (I'm not sure I'd recommend this in high summer). You can buy tickets in some banks and shops. Also the Doble de Oro pass is worth considering if you are in Granada for more than a day. Any way you buy your ticket it's very cheap for the great experience.Tip2:Your ticket is for timed entry to the Nasrid palaces, but you can spend an hour or three inside the complex quite easily looking at the Alcazaba, the palace of Carlos V (where there is a very quiet museum and sometimes interesting art exhibitions) and the Generalife gardens. There are restaurants and cafes inside.Tip3:The 'h' in Alhambra is silent and 'Generalife' is pronounced heneraleefay.Tip4:Just go there!"
"Adam Schaefter";"Aspen, Colorado - Book a tour from Seville - 4";2016-08-29;"Usually I book one day tours through vendors on Viator, but this seemed so easy that I made the mistake of doing it on my own. I booked the last available time slot online, unaware that admission is in 15 minute intervals. It was cold and rain/sleet was falling. There is no accommodation to wait for your entry time if you arrive early so be prepared for the weather and to sit upon stone. My side trip was cursed upon arrival in Seville, when I went to the bus station to buy my tickets. The helpful young woman assisted me at the kiosk and even though she spoke English, she issued a return ticket for the next day, not the same day...and I failed to check it. The trip to Granada was easy. By the time I paid for the taxi from the bus station to the Alhambra ticket office, waited in line, took the taxi to the site, took the taxi to the bus station, etc., I had spent more than the private tour would have cost. However, this is a cautionary tale. Without the kindness of the bus driver, I would have been left in Granada to sleep on floor in the bus station because the ticket was for the next day, Holy Thursday, and hotels were filled for Semana Santa Celebrations. The Alhambra is spectacular and should be visited and enjoyed for all the visual sensations. Take a tour and really enjoy your day!"
"Joe Flacco";"Hawaii - Deserves its fame and its spot as the most visited attraction in Spain - 5";2015-05-14;"In spite of all of the hype, we experienced no letdown during our visit to the Alhambra. The overall design is beautiful, the tile work, vaults and carvings inside are magnificent, and the gardens blend beautifully with the Moorish architecture. We were very happy with the way we planned our visit. We first visited the Nasrid Palace at night. Although you miss a lot of detail because of the low lighting, we certainly got a feel for the place. There was no mistaking the beauty and it was amazing to be in some of the rooms with no one else there. We also enjoyed the quiet! We returned the following day for the full visit including the Nasrid Palace and the Generalife gardens. You can also enjoy the views of the city and countryside at both times, though of course you can see more during the day. I strongly recommend this approach. For much of the year, it is imperative to get your tickets ahead of time and I recommend that you do so if at all possible. It was quite easy to buy tickets on line through Ticketmaster via the official Alhambra web site. Before you go to the Alhambra, you can save time by going to any LaCaixa Bank ATM. You have to search a bit on the screen but you will find a button to click to get Alhambra tickets. With those, you do not have to wait in line at the Alhambra gate, other than waiting for your time to enter. We went to the ATM on Calle Gran Via de Colon. Unfortunately a group of panhandlers camps out there, at least they were there each time we passed. They did not cause us any problem but if that will make you uncomfortable, you might want to look for another ATM."
"Al Davis";"Chicago - Book Far in Advance - 5";2016-10-05;"We were unable to secure tickets online even a month before our trip. We did however, book a tour with Viator, the ""Exclusive Priority Access to Alhambra and Generalife Gardens,""a three hour tour and were relieved that we would be able to visit this important site. The tour was quite disorganized, very large with 31 guests, and the most disappointing was it DID NOT include the palaces. (This was very misleading.) So the most important advise is: BOOK YOUR TICKETS ON LINE FAR IN ADVANCE.The Alcazaba or fortress/military area is one of the oldest parts of the complex. It has several towers which can be climbed in order to behold wide views of the city. The Generalife is a beautiful area replete with connecting gardens containing sculptures, water and fountain accents and calming architectural features. It was the ""get away"" for the royal family-- an idyllic place to relax.Other features of interest within the walking paths include the splendid Palace of Charles V, now used as a museum and exhibition hall, the baths of the Mosque with beautiful arches and tiles, and the archaeological area presently being dug and studied.HINT: The square on Paseo del Padre Manjon, on the opposite side of the Darro River overlooks the Alhambra for spectacular views and photos. Adjacent to the square is a Mosque with the same view and less crowds."
"Joe Flacco";"Nantwich, Cheshire, UK - Truly magnificent  - 5";2014-06-13;"All the superlatives in the TA reviews are deserved, this is a must see in Andalucia so book early online and don't miss out. I won't repeat everything below, suffice to say it is genuinely breathtaking. Our tips: The automatic kiosks to pick up tickets bought online are very badly signposted and we only spotted them after waiting 10 mins in the queue for the manned desks. They are behind the shop. The audioguide was excellent and really completed our visit, however the organisation at the site made it harder than it ought to have been to get hold of one. We were in the afternoon session and very few audioguides had been handed back to the main entrance so there was a huge queue of people wanting one but only a handful of them. The staff were extremely unhelpful and despite my attempts at Spanish, we were met with shrugs and apathy when we tried to ask for information as to if we could get one elsewhere. We needn't have worried, there is another site which hires them outside the Nasrid Palace/ Carlos V. Just a shame the staff couldn't have told us this. Make sure you have a driving licence or similar to leave as deposit. Overall, the Alhambra is stunning. Devote a day to it and take it all in at your own pace. It really is the highlight of Andalucia."
"Joe Flacco";"Wilton, California - Beyond Belief - 5";2015-06-13;"We were spending a week in Seville and decided it would be a great time to go see The Alhambra of myth and tales and Washington Irving fame. We got a room, we got our train ticket, but it took nearly two days to secure both sets of tickets we needed. I highly suggest getting the tickets first and save a lot of grief. We're collecting UNESCO World Heritage sites and this was a doozy. The only thing close we've seen was the Royal Alcazar in Seville, and choosing the best of the two would be tough, but we're really glad we went. It is a huge space. Lots of walking and climbing and it's starting to get hot out. But, seeing the fortress in it's current state is magical. I think 648 pictures in one day may be a new record for me. I think the most enduring and special part for me is the water containment and flow captured and used to keep all the fountains and gardens green and beautiful. Still, today we can watch the actions take place. The buildings are incredible structures with the grandest of Moorish designers and craftsmen, using geometrical designs in everything as reproduction of human forms was forbidden. Amazing imaginations. I loved the arches, alcoves, inlays and cutouts allowing light in, but just so much. The tiling and construction materials and methods are outstanding considering the time period. We had not expected to see the Palace at night but it was quite amazing. I'm sure things were visible to us that daytime visitors may miss, like the lights coming through those delicate holes in the window coverings. You hated to leave."
"Jim Harbaugh";"London, United Kingdom - Absolute must see! - 5";2014-09-26;"So much has been said and read about how amazing this place is: I got to Granada unsure whether I'd be able to visit it at all, as it's highly recommended to book your ticket online but when I decided on my trip 3 weeks before it was already showing sold out... As I enquired at the -not so helpful- Tourist Information they were pushing for me to by a tourist ticket for EUR38 but the Alhambra is only EUR13.5 and the other museums you get access to for the deal are just not ones I was interested in (and not the ones in the centre!). So the last option was to get there early indeed: I arrived at 6:45am to start queuing for the 8:30am opening, and already there were about 40 people in front of me.Tip: it's cold at this time of day: bring a jumper/jacket.that morning they had about 200 entries for both the morning access and the afternoon access (ie 400 in total). I'd estimate that the queue by 08:30am was about 200 people... so BE THERE EARLY.In any case, I managed to get in, and it was absolutely 100% worth the early set off, the queue, the cold, the unsufferable amount of tourists...The place is amazingly beautiful at dawn when it's quieter. there's a little kiosk selling coffees and sandwiches so you can sit there and enjoy the view with a warm/refreshing drink depending on the time of day!so much history so much detail in the architecture... just go see it!"
"Adam Schaefter";"Cahors - Not to be missed - 5";2013-01-10;"Absolutely deserves to be a World Heritage Site. Quite Stunning and great views inside over old Granada. Well signed from the autoroute and keep following until you come to the large official carpark. Tickets for a general visit are 18 euros each and it seems this is for a morning or afternoon entry. You can avoid the queues by going to a different area of the entry complex and buy your ticket by credit card. Much quicker. On your ticket will be printed the time for your entry into the Nazrid Palaces. This is very strictly controlled so make sure you are at the area in plenty of time, and join the queue. The wait is worth it. No dogs are allowed inside the buildings. However, if you walk down the hill outside the Alhambra and keeping the main entry building on your right, at the bottom, you start to go uphill, still keeping the Palace walls on your right, you will come to one of the old entry gates and you can gain entry into the gardens without paying for a ticket. And please, this is perfectly in order and no offences are being committed. The gardens are worth seeing in their own right. There are restaurants and bars in the area outside so you will not go hungry. I can't comment about wheelchair access but given the historical age of the buildings, unfortunately I did not see facilities for this. Wheelchair users would be able to at least see the gardens."
"Bill O'Brien";"Ipswich, United Kingdom - As amazing as they say - 5";2016-04-13;"We parked at the Alhambra main parking in the morning, walked down into Granada and visited the cathedral and the El Albayzín walking up to the viewpoints across to the Alhambra. We then walked back down to Plaza Isabel La Catolica and took the C3 little red bus up the hill (saving a tiring walk!). We had booked timed tickets for the the Nazari Palace at the Alhambra for 5pm a few months earlier so avoided any queues. We turned up at the Alhambra entrance around 4pm and looked around the rest of the main site, then when we got to the Palace there was a short wait to be admitted. Although there were quite a few people around we managed to lack behind the main 5pm crowd and had some of the rooms to ourselves for a few moments at least. It really lives up to its reputation, hard to resist continually taking photos but at the same time you just want to soak it all in. Worth going twice, once with a camera and once without! After that we wandered the Generalife Gardens and stayed until around 7:30pm by which time it was almost deserted - a perfect time to wander. We ended up with a nice toasted sandwich at the Parador Cafeteria in the Alhambra grounds - with views across to the Generalife and then back to the car park. A perfect day."
"Joe Flacco";"Cortez, Florida - The Alhambra A UNESCO World Heritage Site - 5";2013-05-19;"Our shore excursion, that we individually planned with Barcelona Day Tours/Top Day Tours Group, began at the port of Malaga when the Eurodam docked. Debby greeted us and began this exciting day by explaining highlights of the area we were driving through on our way to Granada. Once we arrived at The Alhambra, Dani took over the actual on site tour.The complex was begun in1237 and used by a series of Sultans and Monarchs.It is noteworthy that American author Washington Irving was inspired to write his TALES OF THE ALHAMBRA after a visit in 1829. The architectural majesty is combined with working vegetable gardens that are adjacent to some really impressive structures. This excursion requires some stamina. Any one with walking difficulty could find this quite challenging. If you are able and ready to be impressed, it's a must see and do ! The guided tour Dani conducted with the help of individual headsets she provided us was outstanding. Something important as to where to have lunch, was taken care of by Debby who suggested a spot where a glass of beer you bought had complimentary Tappas come with it. Not only good, but very reasonable ! The overall experience that began on the internet with Emilia and Sofia working with Ulla to organize a superb shore excursion ended to applause and compliments. We highly recommend this team if you're lucky enough to go where they operate. Well done and many thanks, Ulla and Dan"
"Jim Harbaugh";"Llantwit Major, United Kingdom - Worth the effort - 5";2014-09-15;"I was dreading this visit! At home I had gone on line and booked a slot to see the Nazrid palaces, 9.30 am. I knew we had to go up there the previous day, immediately we had arrived to transform our reservation into tickets. There was much talk of queues, crowds, confusion and problems on this site, so we were quite anxious. We took the bus up to the entrance and found no queue atall and were able to get our tickets at once. After a delicious ice cream we walked back to the town through a pleasantly shaded pathway. The following morning we retraced our footsteps with entrance time worrying us, although we were there in good time. Fortunately we found the queue, waited in it, had our tickets looked at and gained entry to the Alhambra complex. What a relief!The Nazrid palaces were very busy and although fantastic, the crowds meant there was little magic in the atmosphere. The views are beautiful, over the city, and in its heyday with robed servants drifting about and busy noblemen hurrying to do their master's bidding, it must have been very different. The gardens both within and outside the palaces are a delight. Plenty of benches to sit down on for regular drinks. Clearly marked visit route. Liked museum in Charles V place as quieter, and approved of displays, clear explanations and elegant objects like the gazelle vase. We went into the site at 8.45 and did not leave until nearly one o'clock, and this was without a teleguide or more than brief notes of what to see. It is a large site, plenty of toilets, clearly laid out.Today we have seen the Alhambra from the other side of the city, and it looks great. I am very glad we made the effort, and congratulations to all the other visitors who managed to negotiate the ticket system!"
"Al Davis";"New York City, New York - Spain's crown jewel, a breathtaking Moorish palace, not to miss - 5";2016-01-03;"""The Alhambra is Granada’s – and Europe’s – love letter to Moorish culture, a place where fountains trickle, leaves rustle, and ancient spirits seem to mysteriously linger."" I couldn't put it better than the Lonely Planet guidebook description. But here's a bit more about our visit... I have wanted to visit the Alhambra for many years, and even with all the hype it far surpassed expectations. (We took a special trip to Granada just so I could see it.) Make sure to tour the entire thing from the front palace all the way back to the Generalife gardens in the back. I would allocate a half day (at minimum 3 hours) to seeing it. Kudos to the Spanish government as it is beautifully maintained, and lovingly restored where needed.  As we were short on time, we opted for a private guided tour in the morning, arranged through our hotel the Alhambra Palace. I highly recommend doing this (or even a group) as tickets do sell out and can be difficult to acquire in advance. Also, the palace is steeped in history and unless you have time to do some reading and prep in advance, a guide is the only way to truly appreciate the history of the place.Last but not least, we visited in offseason, in late November on the Saturday after Thanksgiving. We couldn't have been luckier, there were no crowds and at times we had the entire place to ourselves. I know this isn't possible for most, but consider a late Novemeber trip. Temperatures were still seasonable (low 60sF) and sunny."
"Bill O'Brien";"Sitges, Spain - Definately worth the visit...what you need to know! - 4";2013-05-20;"So I won't spend hours telling you that you should see this...if you are in Granada chances are you are here to see the Alhambra. So what are the things you need to know:- Buy your tickets weeks before you travel (they sell out)- Print the tickets before you show up (you can pick them up in Caixa ATMs) - the line is quite long if you want to pick them up at the Alhambra- Put comfortable walking shoes! (use sun screen if sunny or take boots if clouded) - this is a long outdoor toor with a lot of walking- Take water or drinks along with you - you can buy some before you go in but don't remember seeing much inside- Depending on your passion for gardens plan between 2-4 hours for the whole thing (you can stay longer but then you are really taking your time - hard to stay less than 2 hours given the size of the place)- Read about it before coming! (the audio guides are OK but are a very imperfect substitute for real information - be prepared to hear a lot of poetic phrases about ""water"")- For the must-see parts (i.e. Nazaries palaces) you get a ticket with a time when you can go in: the line takes about 30 minutes - be prepared to do it and don't go too early...they will not let you get in until it is actually ""your time""...they are very strict so don't be there late either...- For really cool pictures go to the hill across from the Alhambra after sunset (they light it up which is quite nice)- I heard there were night visits...but know nothing about them...if you are interested ask about that!That is all I need to say...but definately worth visiting!"
"Bill O'Brien";"Tring - An incredible place! - 5";2014-09-08;"We booked our tickets online, three months in advance through ticketmaster.es. We bought the Alhambra and Generalife ticket which also allowed entry into the Nasrid Palaces. During the booking process you choose whether you want the morning or afternoon slot and a specific half hour slot for the Nasrid Palaces. You can collect your tickets from ANY Caixa Bank ATM, in Granada or elsewhere in Spain. There is a Caixa branch on Calle Gran Via de Colon which is where we collected ours from.We then walked from there to the Alhambra. It was a lovely walk through old cobbled streets and the leafy hillside leading up to the entrance. We were able to go straight through with no delays as we had already picked up our tickets. The site is simply stunning. From the views across Granada to the palaces and gardens themselves. You definitely need to maximise your time there so aim to arrive as early as possible for your slot to take it all in. Each part of the complex complements the other so I highly recommend visiting as much of it as possible, between the Alhambra, Generalife and the Nasrid Palaces. There are shops and cafes as well as a hotel on the grounds for refreshments or a coffee stop. The Alhambra complex in itself warrants a visit to Granada!"
"Tom Brady";"Oxford England - One of the wonders of the world - 5";2015-04-14;"This is one of the greatest things in Spain and one of the wonders of the mediaeval world. You need a whole day to see it properly as the Alhambra is more than one palace, it's more like a little town on top of a mountain. The gardens are wonderful, in the very calm and shady Moorish style, with many cypress trees and fountains. There are towers, churches, ramparts, old Turkish baths and two major palaces - that of the Spanish kings and that of the Moorish sultans. The latter, the palace of Nazaries, is exquisite, and must be the highlight of any visit. It has many chambers and courtyards carved intricately like ivory. The windows overlook the city far below and the views are stunning. Look carefully at your ticket as you are only allowed in at the exact time stated, If you miss it you will have to come back maybe days later and pay again. The palace of the Hapsburg kings is also fine and remarkable - it contains an art gallery that is worth seeing. If you like you can visit the Alhambra at night, when it is all illuminated. I would recommend this for romantics!The guided visits are worth the money if you want to go by coach and avoid the walk up the hill, but you can get in for much less without a guide and actually the walk from the town is beautiful, through a park. If you go unguided you can just wander, which we really preferred."
"Adam Schaefter";"McLean, Virginia - Spectacular -- a real wonder of the world - 5";2015-10-31;"This is a spectacular site, very well maintained, that should be in the top ten of every traveler's must sees. The gardens are stunning and the Nasrin Palaces spectacular: there are three: the Mexuar Palace, Comares Palace (with its famous court of myrtles and reflecting pond... and our favorite - the iconic ""Palace of the Lions"". The interiors and the associated gardens are simply stunning. Don't forget the ""Generalife"" with its lower and upper gardens and impressive Palace with it's water feature. The Generalife was the ""get away from it all"" area for the Kings of Granada (a quick, safe walk away from the main palaces - but a world away in the feeling of quiet isolation). The gardens are about water and scent and their architecture is superb -- everywhere you'll hear the sound of water flowing (even in the interior bedroom of the Palace of the Lions!). If you can spare the time check out the water stairway in the Generalife and the Silla Del Moro - which blended defense of the Generalize (from ambitious sons of the King) and handled water distribution to the entire Alhambra. Conservation is superb. You'll need 4-5 hours to absorb it all so don't try to short yourself time wise. Go early as it can get crowded! While we didn't have time for the Alcazaba, we opted instead for a visit inside the Palace of (Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire) Charles V (which was never occupied, with interior decoration stopped by the death of his empress). The circle with the square layout of this building is stupendous - so do not miss going inside the interior courtyard of this breathtaking building. The baths of the mosque are impressive too. Some nice shops with world famous marquetry/parquetry. It's a UNESCO World Heritage Site - and among the finest of them all."
"Al Davis";"Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania - Just as good 30 years later, but more crowded - 5";2016-04-02;"Even if you are not big on the history, the absolute beauty of the architecture and the surrounding countryside should not be missed. The many occupants from ancient times have also left their different marks, as explained on the many plaques throughout the site (in english). This is easily a full day experience: RESERVE TICKETS ON LINE PRIOR TO YOUR VISIT and show up an hour before your ticket time. This can be the make or break detail for your access to the palace itself (limited entry per half day visits). We did not get to the palaces though from my memory and others you really should. Generalife Palace was beautiful as well (part of the overall Alhambra access) The grounds and many small courtyard, gardens and fountains will keep you busy as well. Do climb up the towers * ub the Alcazaba section to see the view from this massive complex. Keep in mind there is a rather long walk (sometimes steep) from the entry gates up to the ticket pavillion, though there are buses from town if you want to save your feet for the touring. There is a small hotel on the property which was a luxury stop for hot tea and bocadillo de jamon as a break from the weather on this rainy day (come prepared)."
"Jim Harbaugh";"Cookham, United Kingdom - Disappointing! - 3";2013-06-20;"Whilst BIG and physically impressive, the Palace (which you have to wait for your strictly timed entrance time, in intense heat) is extremely disappointing as it contains 'nothing' and so it has no soul or atmosphere - archivists of this site should consider the use of visuals (digital or otherwise) to give visitors an understanding of what these 'huge empty spaces' were used for and as.In addition, there was very limited information - (unless willing to pay an extra 6.50 Euros for an audio guide which, in my opinion was a waste of money) - around the site and when information was available, it was in Spanish and/or extremely poorly written English (not helpful for the array of overseas visitors). Staff on site only spoke Spanish too and so they were unable to assist, when asked! One positive note - the gardens (with a huge quantity of roses) was spectacular as were the views.Anyone even slightly unfit or disabled should NOT attempt a visit to Alhambra - walking around the site is difficult (extremely uneven surfaces) for the fittest visitor and there are only a few areas to shade from the sun.All in all, as an avid 'historical site' visitor, I was extremely disappointed - for the price charged, if this is the best, I would suggest visiting Italy where they understand tourism and what visitors expect!"
"Adam Schaefter";"Belfast - Wonderful experience - 5";2015-04-04;"After booking ticket in January and lucky to get it via ticketmaster (€15.40) for my dates in Granada, I was keen to visit to visit the monumental complex of the Alhambra and the Generalife, it didn't disappoint. It was a busy time as it was during Semana Santa (Holy Week). With over 66 places of interest in the accompanying map, you need to give yourself all the time allocated to stroll around. Don't however be late for your visit to the Nasrid Palaces as you will not get in after your allocated time. Some tried to skip the queue by going at earlier time on the ticket but, proper order, this was not allowed.Access the site via the gate in the Southern wall. Walk to the Plaza Neuva and look out for Cuesta de Gomerez, walk up the hill and through the gate. It is a steep, climb so be warned, flat shoes and plenty of water is required, it's worth it though. If mobility is a problem, get a taxi or the Granada City Tour has a stop at it, it's a hop on hop off tour so no need for the hike if you're not up for it.I collected my tickets the day before my tour which was handy as I knew where exactly to go and walked straight to the entrance on day of visit. Bring plenty on snacks and bite to eat. if you've a handy cool bag, would be worth bringing. The audio guide was €6.50 and worth it, you'll be asked to leave an ID or credit card as an assurance for it.The Alhambra and Generalife is really nothing short of spectacular, loads of history, wonderfully preserved and looked after and while walking around, I couldn't help letting my mind wander by wondering what it would have been like to have lived there over the centuries."
"Joe Flacco";"New York City, New York - Worth enduring the extreme heat ... absolutely stunning! - 4";2016-08-07;"The Alhambra is just stunning. The architecture is fantastic, the views and the gardens are breath-taking. As others say, do book ahead, as there are very few tickets available the day of your visit. Be prepared - water bottles, sun screen, hats, and comfortable shoes. There is a lot of walking and you don't want to miss anything. There are also lots of places to sit and take a breather, and there are scattered water fountains to refill bottles. One major glitch our party encountered was in one of the major gardens - 2 of us sat on a bench to catch a breather and were summarily stung by multiple bees - my friend twice, and me 7 times. As we walked to the Red Cross station, we saw a pole/chain ""thingie"" that was thrown in the bushes and probably had been in place blocking the bench at some time. We stopped to tell a groundskeeper who was watering the grass about the encounter with the bees and she could not have cared less. At first she kept telling us that she wasn't allowed to spray water on patrons (we all speak Spanish and clearly were NOT asking her for that) ... then she shrugged and went back to watering. The Red Cross team was fabulous - attentive, kind, organized, and thorough. They called the main office right away and urged them to block the bench properly and tend to the bee's nest at once. Be careful where you sit ... but otherwise, go and enjoy the incredibly rich history that the Alhambra has to offer."
"Adam Schaefter";"Plainview - Worth seeing but not my favorite site in Spain. - 4";2016-02-20;"Went at the time of year when it should have been quiet. Did not use a tour guide as we planned on getting the audio guides. Since we booked the tickets on line in advance for the Palacios Nazaries or Nazrid Palace (suggested) for 1:00pm or 13:00, we arrived in time but did not get the audio guides so luckily I had printed out some of the factual information about the different areas and sites to see at the Alhambra. The flowers were not in bloom in the Gardens but everything else was easily accessible except that there were lots of school kids. There are great views from the bell tower, and while in the Palace, check out the magnificent cedar door in the northern end in the Hall of the Ambassadors where Queen Isabella received Christopher Columbus. In the heart of the harem area, is the Patio de los Leones (Court of the Lions) with a fountain with 12 lions thought to represent the months of the zodiac with 4 streams flowing symbolically to the 4 corners of the cosmos and more literally to the surrounding state apts. Since we drove to Granada from Estepona, you will get directions to Granada but must follow carefully the signs to the Alhambra and then to the parking area. They have kiosks to pay so take the ticket with you to pay before you get to your car. Not too bad 6 euro.However, I paid ticketmaster at home 30 euro and it was 28 for 2 for the Nazrid Palace but didn't have to wait on a longer line."
"Adam Schaefter";"Winchester, England, United Kingdom - Fascinating tour - The conquest of water (conquista del agua) - 5";2014-06-07;"Firstly, please heed other warnings – order your tickets online at least 4+ weeks before your visit. I tried to book 2 weeks before and all tickets for the Nasrid palace were fully booked. Instead, I booked the family on a guided tour - The conquest of water (La conquista del agua). The tour was excellent, with a very knowledgeable guide, Guillermo, who clearly explained how water is used, how it is sourced and the (frightening) drop in river water levels between medieval times and now. Guillermo also managed to keep my two teens engaged throughout. What I hadn’t realised though (as I didn’t know the room names well enough), is that this tour starts in the Generalife and then takes you through the Nasrid palace rooms too. Yes, the tour is more expensive than standard tickets, but its comprehensive nature, the non-public rooms you visit and the additional historical perspective you gain are worth it. The only disappointment is that the tour finishes outside the Alhambra gates so you can’t continue wandering around the gardens without paying for an additional ticket.I would highly recommend visiting the Alhambra, the palaces are fantastic and gardens are a gem and they are in full flower in late May."
"Jim Harbaugh";"Lancashire - Must See - 5";2012-09-17;"Cannot imagine visiting Granada without visiting The Alhambra. absolutely brilliant in all respects. Very good info on TA about planning visit. However...... a couple of things to be aware of. We bought our tickets in advance of our trip, as per all advice, (seems pretty essential) and printed tickets off at the Alhambra Book Shop on Calle de los Reyes Catolicos before walking up there, and were told that having done so we could enter by the Puerta de la Justicia instead of walking all the way up to the main entrance. Fine, except after queuing there for a short time, a steward walked down the line shouting something in very rapid Spanish, and about half the people left the queue and walked to the front. Assuming that this applied to those with pre-printed tickets we did likewise, only to be shooed away very abruptly, as was nearly everyone else, accompanied by a tirade in rapid Spanish, which meant we had lost our place in said queue. Still have no idea what the criteria was for the few who were let through first. Wasn't that big a deal though, we got in no problem a few minutes later, but found that we had missed the chance to hire an audio guide or buy any kind of guide. Seems you have to do this before you enter the Nasrid Palace, though we only found out where later as the guides inside were neither pleasant nor helpful, and there is very little in the way of signage. (Turns out you can hire Audio guide at Museum on right just before end of Nasris queue)Would have got a lot more out of the visit with such information, but very worthwhile visit nevertheless. Allow a good four hours or so I suggest."
"Adam Schaefter";"Leicester, United Kingdom - It's not a World Heritage Site for nothing! Awe-inspiring... - 5";2014-08-10;"You are most unlikely to be in Granada and not go to the Alhambra with it being a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Do get tickets beforehand, though, as there are many thousands going through the various parts of the Alhambra complex every day so the tickets are timed. We met someone who applied to the ticket office early in the morning (as we were going in) and their tickets were for 1330 which is a long wait if you’ve no other plans. Starting early was, for us, a good idea and we had an excellent guide to explain all the historic, artistic, religious and cultural points of each room we visited. This is far better than trying to read a guidebook as you are going through. In each space we were given enough time for personal exploration and to take photos. There were some very obvious tour groups on tight schedules who just swept by taking selfies and having photos of themselves taken in every room with their hapless guides intoning shortened versions of their scripts into their microphones hoping that the entourage was listening. That left the place rather easier for us. Many of the rooms are unbelievably ornate and/or serenely beautiful and in wonderful spaces with water everywhere. The use of water throughout the complex defies belief even considering the techniques were developed so many centuries ago. The attached amateur photos are only a small portion of those I took and they are simply chosen to reflect those breathtaking moments engendered by this remarkable place. We did the Nasrid Palaces first followed by the Alcazaba and then the Generalife. All quite different but a good way to see them. Is one of the best places I have seen in Spain? Absolutely…"
"Adam Schaefter";"New York City, New York - Beautiful! - 5";2013-01-06;"The Alhambra is clearly the gem of Granada! With beautiful views all-around and pristine gardens, this is really worth the ticket price. Be sure to get your tickets in advance online, though! There is a bus that can take you up and down the big hill, though the walk up is pretty. It can be confusing as to where exactly the entrance is when you're walking, so the bus might be a better option if you're on a time crunch. Leave yourself plenty of time to get to the Nasrid Palace, as it is a 10-15 minute walk from the ticket collection area and you should get there 10 or so minutes in advance.The plus side to this system is that it prevents overcrowding in the palace-- a very good idea. Helped keep the experience peaceful and allowed us to take photographs without having to elbow people or worry about waiting for a long time. It did create a bit of stress when trying to get there, however. Picking up our tickets was easy, but the audioguides were a bit tricky (and the €20 deposit for them a bit ridiculous if you dont keep all that much cash on you!). They were also very heavy, which was unfortunate but probably unavoidable. The grounds themselves were beautiful, though the Nasrid palace was a lot of the same throughout and took more time than it was really worth. The views are really the most amazing part, and be sure not to miss the views from the furthest most point (not the Generalife but the other one-- I cannot remember what it is called at the moment). Stunning and well worth it! Also, the cats make for a cute addition."
"Al Davis";"mazarron - Guided tour of the Alhambra - 4";2015-11-11;"We arrived as a couch group of 60, which was then split into 30 persons for each guide. We were issued with receivers and ear pieces so the guide could talk to us without having to shout. It also meant we could dwell over certain sites taking photo's without losing some of the commentary. You must book a time slot on the web if going individually or as a group as entry to the palaces is strictly adhered to. Although the Alhambra is very impressive with the carved plaster walls and tiling after visiting a few rooms it became very samey as all were decorated the same. The unfinished Palace was rather boring as the guide took us in but there really isn't enough to show you from the time it was built. Having finished with the main Palaces we then were taken to the Summer Palace in the Generalife area. Fantastic views of the Alhambra Place and the surrounding area and very grand gardens. Overall a good few hours finding out about how the moors built the place and what happened when the Christians then took it back. Please not though we walked about 4 kilometres and climbed numerous steps its not a tour for the faint hearted. Also children with push chairs are not aloud in the Palaces. Just a small note do go up into the Gypsy area above the Alhambra at night as its very impressive when all lit up at night."
"Bill O'Brien";"York - Inspiring - 5";2015-09-13;"If your visiting Granada, Spainnthen the Alambra Palace and Generalife Gardens are a must see. But would highly recommend that you pre-book your tickets otherwise entry is not guaranteed. I would also suggest a morning visit (8:30 - 2pm) so you can have a full day. You will have time stamps for entry into the Nazrine Palaces and the Plaza De Justice, which must be adhered to or you won't be allowed entry. But other than that you can wander to your hearts content as they don't kick you out at 2pm. The Generalife Gardens are beautiful and very peaceful with benches dotted around for a rest or a picnic. The Alambra Palaces are stunning. The architecture is simply beautiful and very intricate. The place is massive and full of history and has some great views out across the valley to The Albicinian and Sacremonte Quarters. We had a guided tour which was very informative at a cost of €39 per person but general admission is around €16 without the guide. If you have mobility difficulties this would be a difficult visit for you as it is built on a hill so there is a lot of uneven ground inside and some step walking parts as well as stairs etc. To get to the palace entrance from the city you can at least get either the C3 or C4 buses at standard flat rate fares of €1.30 for a single journey or the City Tour Train which is a hop on/off job and runs till 9:30pm at €8 for the day €4 if your over 65 but they will ask for ID to prove that. If you come across the loval gypsies offering bunches of lavender etc please don't take them. Our guide informed that they expect a very high amount of money for them and you are then likely to be removed of your wallet!"
"Joe Flacco";"Dallas, Texas - PLAN AHEAD for Alhambra a true world treasure - 5";2014-11-11;"PLAN AHEAD would be the two words that should be part of any plans for anyone traveling to Granada and with a desire to see the Generalife and Alhambra. The only allow 8,000 people to visit daily and so you have to plan ahead. I wasn't aware of the tight availability and made my purchase 1 week out. It was tough but I got it done. The first tour of the day is 8:30am and so the group met in the lobby of the hotel near the Alhambra and bit of a walk down to the entry area, Its cold in the am so dress in layers. Our group had a very good guide who spoke great english. Each person receives a small receiver with a single over the ear piece. The range is short but it helps to keep the group together. There is so much history and such beautiful subtlety to Alhambra I believe it lends itself to a guide. Your ticket is timed to allow you in certain palaces at certain hours and THEY CHECK. You generallly can wander the gardens until your time expires. Around 1:30pm for our group. BUY your tickets on-line from the website, powered by Ticketmaster of all things or from the various tour companies. Its a beautiful amazing place and the use of water thru-out is stunning. The views of the city below in the morning are amazing as well. Enjoy your tour."
"Jim Harbaugh";"Lincoln, United Kingdom - Well worth a visit - 5";2016-07-12;"It was a mixed day for our family visit. We arrived at 09:30 having booked the El Alhambra Palace walk around for 14:00. We had already booked out tickets online sow hence went to the machine it only printed out 3 tickets with a bar code. The person wrote on one ticket 2:20. When we went to the gate to get in we were told that we needed to come back there at 14:00. We asked about getting in to walk around the rest of the site, but told we needed to come back there at 14:00. It was not explained that there were two other site gates were you can get in free to walk around the other palace sites. We then went there at 14:00, but it was not explained to us that we needed to go directly to the El Alhambra Palace gate for our booked ticket time. When we got to the El Alhambra Palace and cued up to get in, on showing our tickets the person was very rude, shouting at us, taking us away in front of the other people cueing and pointed us in the direction of Information. Here again we were made to feel very small, but told that they would change out ticket time and we should go directly to the gate there and then and we would get in. So for any who intending visiting, make sure you head directly to the Palace entrance in accordance to your ticket time. Nevertheless, despite our experience, walking around the grounds and seeing through the Palace was worth our while visiting."
"Adam Schaefter";"Leeds - Beautiful, but needs to improve customer experience - 4";2014-08-22;"I have been previously to the the Alhambra and did not receive the same level of ticket chaos.I tried to purchase tickets on-line 4 days prior but they had already sold out (probably expected in Aug), so I went the same day (this monday) of visit at 7am to queue for tickets. There was an already substantial queue. Furthermore, the queue did not even move for 1 1/2 hours, which meant a 2 hour wait for tickets. I went in the afternoon and had to queue to get in, and then had to queue once more for 20 mins with no shade to get into the main palace. Consequently, I was then informed that the time on the tickets was wrong for entry to the main palace! Which meant having to get the entry time changed at the tourist information office. Other people were given guides on entry but we were not provided with these and the situation regarding the entry time was not explained.In conclusion.... A poor visitor experience, which needs to be improved from a customer service aspect. I've visited many other famous landmarks and never had to work this hard! On the plus.... Amazing palace and definately worth visiting. I previously visited in the winter and the crowds were less and the views of the mountains were better with the snow covering. Aug was maybe too hot to enjoy the journey around the palace. Additionally, Granada is an amazing place, with great tapas and bars."
"Jim Harbaugh";"UK - Don't leave it too late to fulfill this dream - you need good mobility! - 5";2015-06-30;"Having waited all my life to visit the Alhambra I was a bit put off by all the stuff I read about booking tickets, timings, discounts, queues etc. But I needn't have fretted. It was fabulous. The hotel bought our tickets for us. The bus from the main square took us up for 1.20 Euros. It's a performance at the Alhambra entrance gate for sure. You must get in the right queue - luckily there was a shorter line for people with hotel booked tickets. A security guard calls you forward to the booth to give in your ticket with the ID of the person who booked it. You then get your actual ticket and an audio guide, site map and more advice that you must be at the Nazir's Palace at your pre-booked time (or else!). Then another gate with someone to take your ticket and .. you enter another world!Wonderful gardens of the Generalife (pronounced Generaleefay), beautiful flowers, clipped hedges, fountains and streams of cool water. There was no feeling that the place was crowded as it is so vast. You are allowed into the main Nazir's Palace every half hour and the waiting is indeed tiresome in the heat - nowhere to sit - and they keep to very strict timings. But once you enter you can see why this is necessary. The rooms are not so large and the maximum 300 people per half hour allows you to actually see and take pictures. It is beyond beautiful. Stunning. You can only admire the craftsmanship and artistry of the artisans who built this and lived in the medina outside, in far humbler conditions. The last visit is the to the Alcazar or fortress, whose flags can be seen flying from the town below. There are one or two shops for souvenirs just before you visit the Alcazar and the Nazir's Palace and an excellent cloakroom block with chilled drinks and snacks available. "
"Bill O'Brien";"Sydney, Australia - One of the most beautiful places on Earth but don't buy the night visit - 4";2012-04-27;"Alhambra is a piece of Paradise on Earth. Magnificent, splendorous, beautiful. Adjectives cannot do justice to the overwhelming beauty, serenity and majesty of one of the most beautiful places on the planet..But as usual, (mis) management spoils what should a fabulous experience.I got the ""Circular Azul"" ticket, and ended up visiting the Nasrid Palaces at nightime, thinking they would look splendid.Big mistake!!! Not only the marvelous halls and areas of the Palace were poorly and inadequately lit, but the staff took more than 20 minutes to get everybody in but were absolutely eager to leave 5 minutes earlier. That mean to me entering at 22:50hrs and being expeditiuosly and unashamedly expelled at 23:25pm. In total, I just had 35 minutes to see one of the wonders of the world and was not aware of that at all. Because of course, when you buy the night visit ticket, they say you will go in at 22:30hrs but it's never clear that just until 23:30hrs. Otherwise, I had chosen a different ticket. I really felt cheated and defrauded.So my advice to fellow travelers who want to enjoy the stunning beauty of Alhambra is: avoid the nightime visits and get yourself into the extasis of its beauty at daytime!"
"Al Davis";"London, United Kingdom - Slightly over rated - 4";2012-07-31;"Visitor experience does not appear to be a high priority for the Alhambra. They think they have a first class attraction and don't need to try. Getting into the Alhambra is not easy and the staff are unfriendly and unhelpful.Our family (2 adults and 3 children, ages ranging from 11-16) viisted the Alhambra one afternoon at the end of July. We had heard that obtaining tickets at the Alhambra could be difficult and time-consuming, so we did all we could to minimise problems tickets, collecting them in advance from a Caixa machine. This did not prevent problems, as a barcode didn't print on one of the children's tickets and we had to queue in the hot afternoon sun to rectify this and get in.We then queued for about half an hour, again in the sun to get into the Nazrid Palace, the supposed jewel in the crown. It wasn't worth the wait. It was okay, but the queuing in the sun had put everyone in a bad frame of mind. Once out of this palace, the rest of the family had had enough and took a taxi back to the hotel. My husband stayed and went round the Generalife. By this time it was six o'clock in the evening, the temperature was slightly cooller and the place emptier. It was more relaxing, the gardens were shadier and more enjoyable. This was pleasant.The Alhambra needs to do a lot to improve the visitor experience."
"Tom Brady";"Northampton, United Kingdom - Last minute, decided to visit Granada and the Alhambra - 5";2013-12-27;"We visited here on Friday the 20th December 2013. Took a drive up in the morning and decided it was too cold and too busy, so went home to change, decided to do4 the afternoon tour. There is parking, which in season is a bit much but we did take that into account and the final price was not too bad considering we did not want to go on an organised tour.There is a cash machine, just past the gift shop, as they only take Euros, or Dollars and not card, we had just run out of cash. When we got to the gift shop we saw the ticket machines, we got Daytime visit passes which were not bad, something like €13 each (cannot remember) so we did not have to go and stand back in the line for tickets. As we were approaching we got offered the audio guide, the big white ones, which look like a phone, they are €6 each. Did not really need them, but it was worth it, saved me having to search everything on my phone.It is absolutely stunning, so much history and architecture packed into such a small area. We spend the full time there from 2 until 6 - I believe it is longer in the Summer (our entry to the palace was marked as 15:00 - well worth the small wait we had.)The views are amazing, especially of the Sierra Nevada,(Mountains, just behind the Alhambra, these were snow covered and just added to the atmosphere.) It was bitterly cold but we had clear blue sky It seems super busy, so if you intend to visit in the warmer months, I would book well in advance. There are warm and cold drink dispensing machines near the bathrooms which are only €1 a drink so not bad at all."
"Tom Brady";"Los Angeles, CA - Understand the ticketing system and you'll love the Alhambra! - 5";2010-03-26;"The Alhambra is a fantastic place to visit, but it's important to understand the ticketing system. The grounds are broken up into three ticketed areas: the Generalife Gardens, the Alcazar, and the Nasrid Palace, plus the unticketed Carlos V Palace. The admission is divided into half days (morning and afternoon), and everyone has a specific time assigned for entrance into the Nasrid Palace. As others have noted, you MUST be at the Nasrid Palace at your assigned time. Additionally, you can only visit the Generalife and the Alcazar in the morning if you have a morning ticket and in the afternoon if you have an afternoon ticket. We saw some very unhappy people being turned away from the Generalife at 2:15 p.m. because they had morning tickets. If you have a morning ticket, apparently no one will force you to leave the grounds in the afternoon, but you can’t get into the ticketed areas. So, be sure to plan your visit carefully.Because the Alhambra is very popular and sells out, we purchased our tickets online from the United States before our trip. We did not have any trouble picking up our tickets with our credit card from the automated machine at the Alhambra. I don’t believe it asked for the credit card’s PIN, but you should know it just in case.Having come prepared, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Alhambra. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience and one of the highlights of our trip to Spain."
"Adam Schaefter";"Cockermouth, United Kingdom - Beautiful, But need good walking shoes - 5";2012-03-27;"The alhambra is beautiful but it is also very big. So plan your visit. BUY YOUR TICKET ON LINE AT LEAST 6 WEEKS IN ADVANCE. The best times are booked about 2-3 months beforehand and pick them up in town at the information/library/ book store at Calle Rayes Catolico The best time to enter the Nasrid palace is late morning so that you can enter the monument in the morning and stay all day if you have the energy and you are a real culture vulture. The average tourist will lose interest and get foot weary after 2-3 hours.You can enter the area via the main gate only during the time your have booked - either morning or after 2. (I did not try the night visit)BUT you can enter any time via the Justice gate - go to one of the hotels (preferably the expensive one - Parador and have a nice breakfast/lunch or tea depending on when you want your break. It costsabout the same as the tourist traps just outside the monument. The 3 areas worth spending time are: Nasrid Palace, Alazabar for the amazing views of Granada and the Generalife for the views and the gardens. I wouldn't bother with the other areas except for the hotel.( I did miss the museum on this visit because it was closed on monday but my memory of the museum was that the building was the main attraction)Visited 15 years ago with a 4 year old boy and it was difficult - push chair access was not easy. It has improved a lot and it was definitely easier to visit without small children. I wouldn't drag a toddler or an under 8 for a day of torture under the hot sun."
"Al Davis";"Montreal, Canada - Not to be missed! - 5";2013-11-13;"Truly lovely. I don't want to repeat everything in the other reviews, so will just say that this truly is a fantastic historical treasure and you must go. However, if you can't get a ticket online, DON'T DESPAIR! We had this problem when trying to book a week in advance in October, and I was so sad! But it all worked out fine -- we found instead the Granada City Pass. This handy card can be purchased online (lovegranada.com or Google it) and it includes Alhambra tickets!! It also includes 3 days of bus fare, and admission to lots of other interesting Granada sites. Yes, it was ~30 euros vs the ~15 for just Alhambra admission alone, but I happily paid rather than miss the Alhambra!! We picked up the Granada card at the tourist office - very easy! Comfortable shoes needed...there's lots and lots of walking. There are a few places inside to buy drinks, ice cream, sandwiches, and even a really nice coffee, so you can take a few breaks along the way. Recommend that you understand the timing of the areas which have ticketed access---- there are a few areas you must visit before 2pm if you have the morning pass. We arrived at ~10 am, had Nasrid palace tickets at 1:30 pm, and left by about 2:30 pm...tired but happy! A copy of Washington Irving's ""Tales of the Alhambra"" made the visit complete!!"
"Tom Brady";"Hoganas, Sweden - Amazing Moorish Palace - 4";2014-05-28;"Gorgeous, well preserved palace (okay, this is a ruin - don't expect Polish, French of German castle standard with full furnished rooms!) displaying amazing Moorish architecture and mosaics.Tends to get crowded no matter how the guards try to moderate tourist flows, so be patient!Gorgeous patios and gardens, you can easily spend one hour walking around this place.Only negatives (besides it being packed with visitors) is it's a one-way visitation place, ergo if you leave one part of the tourist route behind, you can't go back and re-enter it. So try and get as much as you possibly can from your first visit!Some guides (like ours) drift off into oblivion, talking about anything and everything that's not in any way related to the castle, but you can't (as I undertstand it) enter without a licensed guide, so choose your guide wisely!The gardens that follow the castle itself are beautiful, offering a splendid view over Generalife and Granada city. Lots of roses and various flowers, tend to smell quite strong (which I loved - but if you're allergic, prepare for this!).Bathroom at entry - there are no bathrooms on the premisses beyond the point of where you show your ticket!Tickets (in May 2014) were €15 per person.Easy segway over to Generalife, the much more modern summer residence and garden neighboring Alhambra."
